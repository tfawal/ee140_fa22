\subsection{Question 1}
What is $V_{DS}$ in the $I_D - V_{GS}$ curves you just plotted? Can you estimate the threshold voltage of the test device? Plot the same $I_D - V_{GS}$ curves for the \texttt{nmos2v} device, and compare threshold voltages of these two $NMOS$ flavors. What is the maximum $V_{DS}$ value of the \texttt{nmos2v} device?\\[0.5cm]
\underline{\textbf{\textit{Solution}}}\\[0.25cm]
Below is a plot of the curves for both the nmos1v and nmos2v devices.\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.45, center]{plot1.PNG}\\
We can estimate the threshold voltage of each device by inspection.  The threshold voltage occurs when the $I_D - V_G$ curve stops being linear.
Below is the $V_{DS}$ for each device using the built-in functions in MATLAB, and the estimated threshold voltage.\\[0.25cm]

In each exercise, a list of specifications are provided along with a semi-complete Matlab script.

You need to complete the Matlab script and verify your design in \textit{Cadence Virtuoso}. For each exercise, provide a table of comparison, comparing your simulated results with the specifications listed for that exercise.\\[0.5cm]

\subsection{Exercise 2: IGS with known $g_m / I_D$, Variable $L$}
\underline{\textbf{\textit{Solution}}}\\[0.25cm]
Below is a screenshot of the completed script in MATLAB, and the results of all parameters.  The parameters were pasted into one spreadsheet for ease of matching the indices.  The row corresponding to the minimum transition frequency is highlighted.\\[0.25cm]
\includegraphics[scale=0.375, center]{mat_res2.PNG}\\[0.25cm]

\newpage
\noindent
Below is a plot of the IGS gain optimization curve.\\[0.25cm]
\includegraphics[scale=0.375, center]{plot3.PNG}\\[0.25cm]
Since we have the constraint that $f_u \leq f_T/10$, we must choose a transition frequency greater than $\approx 5\,GHz$ and the corresponding length and width for two solution sets.  We can also find that maximum length for $L$ based on its correspondance with the first valid transition frequency, as indicated on row 13 from the previous spreadsheet image:
\begin{equation}
    \boxed{L_{MAX} = 0.5 \mu m}
\end{equation}
Based on the results in MATLAB, we are using these two sets of solutions to use for the simulations in Cadence.
