\section{Oscilloscope probe}
\textbf{\emph{Given: }} A few of your colleagues have found an old analog oscilloscope, and want to use it for their class project. The scope is in a good shape, but sadly it doesn’t come with any probes, and they are now asking for your help in fashioning a custom probe.  On the back of the scope, it shows a diagram of the channel’s input and its amplifier, shown in \textit{Fig. 1}.

\includegraphics[scale=0.35, center]{p1a1.PNG}\\

The value of the components in the model are listed below.:

    \begin{table}[H]

    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
        \begin{tabular}{|l|c|}

            $R_{in}$ & $1\,M \Omega$\\
            \hline
            $C_{in}$ & $20\,pF$\\
            \hline
            $G_{in}$ & $10\,mS$\\
            \hline
            $R_{out}$ & $10\,k \Omega$\\
            \hline
            $C_{out}$ & $4\,pF$\\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

\noindent
\textbf{\emph{Find: }} The following for each circuit:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item
    {
    Using the model shown in \textit{Fig. 2}, set the value of $R_{probe}$ such that the impedance looking into the probe tip is $10\,M \Omega$ at DC.
    
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35, center]{p1f1.PNG}\\
    }
    \item
    {
    Find the transfer function for the input voltage of the probe tip to the output of the amplifier.
    \begin{equation*}
        H(s) = \frac{v_{out}(s)}{v_{tip}(s)}
    \end{equation*}
    }
    \item
    {
    What time constant limits the bandwidth of this transfer function?
    }
    \item
    {
    As an update to your design, you decide to add a parallel capacitor ($C_{probe}$) to the $R_{probe}$ as shown in \textit{Fig. 3}. Using the value of $R_{probe}$ from part (\textit{a}), determine the size of $C_{probe}$ such that $\frac{v_{in}(s)}{v_{tip}(s)}$ has an all-pass response.
    
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35, center]{p1f2.PNG}\\
    }
    \item
    {
    Now, what is the $-3\,dB$ bandwidth of the new probe/channel combination?
    }
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\noindent
\textbf{\emph{Solution: }}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    %%% SOLUTION A %%%
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item
    {
    Below is a schematic of applying a test source at DC to find the input resistance:

    \includegraphics[scale=0.1, center]{p1a1.jpg}\\

    We have that $I_X = V_X/(R_{probe} + R_{in})$, which means that $R_X = R_{probe} + R_{in} = 10\,M\Omega$.  Since we are given that $R_{in} = 1\,M\Omega$, the solution is trivial.\\[0.5cm]    
    $\therefore \quad \boxed{R_{probe} \approx 9\,M\Omega}$
    }
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    %%% SOLUTION B %%%
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item
    {
    Below is a schematic of the circuit in the frequency domain for analysis of the transfer function:

    \includegraphics[scale=0.125, center]{p1fd.jpg}\\
    
    To begin, we see that $v_{in}$ forms a voltage divider:
    \begin{align*}
        v_{in} &= v_{tip}\left(\frac{Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2}\right)
    \end{align*}
    
    Nodal analysis at the output and substitution of $v_{in}$ yields:
    \begin{align*}
        0 &= \frac{v_{out}}{Z_3} + G_m v_{in}\\[0.25cm]
        \implies  v_{out} &= - G_m Z_3 \left[v_{tip}\left(\frac{Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2}\right)\right]\\[0.25cm]
        \implies  \frac{v_{out}}{v_{tip}} &= - G_m\left(\frac{Z_2 Z_3}{Z_1 + Z_2}\right)\\[0.25cm]
        &= - G_m\left(\frac{R_{in} \parallel C_{in} \cdot R_{out} \parallel C_{out}}{R_{probe} + R_{in} \parallel C_{in}}\right)\\[0.25cm]
        &= - G_m\left[\frac{\left(\frac{R_{in}}{1 + s R_{in} C_{in}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{R_{out}}{1 + s R_{out} C_{out}}\right)}
                {R_{probe} + \left(\frac{R_{in}}{1 + s R_{in} C_{in}}\right)}\right]\\[0.25cm]
        &= - G_m\left[\left(\frac{R_{in} \cdot R_{out}}{\cancel{(1 + s R_{in} C_{in})}(1 + s R_{out} C_{out})}\right)
                    \cdot \left(\frac{\cancel{(1 + s R_{in} C_{in})}}{R_{in} + R_{probe}(1 + s R_{in} C_{in})}\right)\right]\\[0.25cm]
        &= -\left[\frac{G_m R_{in} R_{out}}{(1 + s R_{out} C_{out})(R_{in} + R_{probe} + s R_{in} R_{probe} C_{in})}\right]
    \end{align*}

    Thus, our final simplified expression for the transfer function:
    \begin{equation}
        \boxed{\frac{v_{out}(s)}{v_{tip}(s)} = -\left(\frac{G_m R_{in} R_{out}}{R_{in} + R_{probe}}\right)\left[\frac{1}{(1 + s R_{in} \parallel R_{probe} C_{in})(1 + s R_{out} C_{out})}\right]}
    \end{equation}
    }
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    %%% SOLUTION C %%%
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item
    {
    We have two poles that determine the bandwidth in our circuit:
    \begin{align}
        f_{P_1} &= \frac{1}{2\pi R_{in} \parallel R_{probe} C_{in}}\\[0.25cm]
        f_{P_2} &= \frac{1}{2\pi R_{out} C_{out}}
    \end{align}
    
    Plugging in the given numerical values yields:
    \begin{align}
        f_{P_1} &\approx 8750\,Hz\\[0.25cm]
        f_{P_2} &\approx 4\,MHz
    \end{align}
    
    The first pole at the lower frequency limits the bandwidth of this filter.
    }
    \newpage
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    %%% SOLUTION D %%%
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item
    {
    Now the only change from our previous transfer function is that $Z_1 = R_{probe} \parallel C_{probe}$.  First let's substitute for $v_{out}$ of the transfer function we found earlier:
    
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{v_{out}}{v_{tip}} &= \cancel{-G_m}\left(\frac{Z_2 \cancel{Z_3}}{Z_1 + Z_2}\right) = \frac{\cancel{-G_m Z_3} v_{in}}{v_{tip}}\\[0.25cm]
        \implies \frac{v_{in}}{v_{tip}} &= \frac{Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2}\\[0.25cm]
        &= \frac{\frac{R_{in}}{1 + s R_{in} C_{in}}}{\frac{R_{probe}}{1 + s R_{probe} C_{probe}} + \frac{R_{in}}{1 + s R_{in} C_{in}}}\\[0.25cm]
        &= \frac{R_{in}}{\cancel{1 + s R_{in} C_{in}}}\left[\frac{(1 + s R_{probe} C_{probe})\cancel{(1 + s R_{in} C_{in})}}{R_{probe}(1 + s R_{in} C_{in}) + R_{in}(1 + s R_{probe} C_{probe})}\right]\\[0.25cm]
        &= \frac{R_{in}(1 + s R_{probe} C_{probe})}{R_{probe}(1 + s R_{in} C_{in}) + R_{in}(1 + s R_{probe} C_{probe})}\\[0.25cm]
    \end{align*}
    
    The only possible value of $C_{probe}$ that will allow an all-pass filter is one large enough to dominate the other pole.  Let's take a limit to show this will work:
    \begin{align*}
        \lim_{C_{probe}\to\infty} &\; \frac{R_{in}(1 + s R_{probe} C_{probe})}{R_{probe}(1 + s R_{in} C_{in}) + R_{in}(1 + s R_{probe} C_{probe})}\\[0.25cm]
        &= \frac{R_{in}(1 + s R_{probe} \infty)}{R_{probe}(1 + s R_{in} C_{in}) + R_{in}(1 + s R_{probe} \infty)}\\[0.25cm]
        &= \cancelto{1}{\frac{R_{in}(\infty)}{R_{in}(\infty)}}
    \end{align*}
    
    $\therefore \quad \boxed{C_{probe} \gg C_{in} \approx \infty}$
    }
    \vspace{1cm}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    %%% SOLUTION E %%%
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item
    {
    Since this is an all-pass filter, it has an infinite bandwidth, meaning that it provides a gain of 1 for all frequencies.
    }

\textbf{\emph{Given: }} Shown in \textit{Fig. 4} is a circuit that is commonly used in high-speed serial link applications to enhance the gain at higher frequencies. Assume $\lambda = 0$, $\gamma = 0$.

    There is a zero at $400\,Hz$, the first pole at $5\,kHz$, and a pole with a multiplicity of two at $60\,kHz$.\\[0.5cm]
    
    The DC gain is $3\,dB$, then we have $20\,\log(A_0) = 3$.  Rearranging:
    \begin{equation}
        A_0 = 10^{\frac{3}{20}} = \sqrt{2}
    \end{equation}
    
    By inspection, the transfer function is:
    \begin{equation}
        \boxed{H(s) = \mathlarger{\mathlarger{\sqrt{2} \left[\frac{(1 + \frac{s}{2\pi \cdot 400\,Hz})}{(1 + \frac{s}{2\pi \cdot 5\,kHz}){(1 + \frac{s}{2\pi \cdot 60\,kHz})}^2}\right]}}}

    For $X$, we find the amount of decade increase using the law of logs:
    
    \begin{align*}
        X &= 3\,dB + 20\,dB(\log_{10}(5000) - \log_{10}(400)) = 3\,dB + 20\,dB(1.0969)\\[0.25cm]
        \implies \Aboxed{X &= 24.94\,dB}

    For $Y$, we use the equation of a slope and have:
    
    \begin{equation}
        X_f - X_0 = m(Y_f - Y_0) \implies -24.94\,dB = -40\,dB/dec(\log_{10}(Y) - \log_{10}(60k))
    \end{equation}
    
    Rearranging, we have:
    
    \begin{align*}
        1 &= -15.06\,\log(Y) + 64.94\,\log(60\,k)\\[0.25cm]
        \implies &\, 15.06\,\log(Y) = 64.94\,\log(60\,k) - 1\\[0.25cm]
        \implies &\, 15.06\,Y = 64.94\,(60\,k) - 10\\[0.25cm]

    $C_S$ causes the zero to appear, and $C_D$ causes the pole to appear.  A zero creates an increase in the slope of the gain, so $C_S$ acting as a wire at lower frequencies in AC conditions allows a larger voltage to appear at the output.  Because $C_D$ acts as a higher frequency pole, when it becomes a wire at its break frequency it allows the amplified current a path to ground and decreases the gain.

    Below is a schematic of the small-signal model.  The input current source was transformed to its Thevenin equivalent circuit.  The body transconductance is included, but will be ignored for the subsequent parts:

    \includegraphics[scale=0.09, center]{p3c_sg.jpg}\\
    }

    We can see that $V_S$ = $V_X$, but with two unknown voltages, we will need three equations.  Analysis of the model yields:
    \begin{align}
        I_X &= -\frac{V_G}{R_G}\\[0.25cm]
        \implies V_G  &= -(I_X \cdot R_G)
        \label{eq:csg1}\\[0.25cm]
        I_X &= g_m V_{XG} + \frac{V_{XD}}{r_o} + \frac{V_X}{R_S}
        \label{eq:csg2}\\[0.25cm]
        0 &= \frac{V_D}{R_D} + \frac{V_{DX}}{r_o} - g_m V_{XG}
        \label{eq:csg3}
    \end{align}

    First let's rearrange \textit{Eq.~\ref{eq:csg3}}, and substitute in \textit{Eq.~\ref{eq:csg1}}
    \begin{align}
        \frac{V_D}{R_D} + \frac{V_{DX}}{r_o} - g_m V_{XG}
        &= V_D\left(\frac{1}{R_D} + \frac{1}{r_o}\right) - \frac{V_X}{r_o} - g_m V_X + g_m V_G\\[0.25cm]
        \implies V_D &= r_o \parallel R_D \left[V_X\left(\frac{1}{r_o} + g_m\right) - g_m V_G\right]\\[0.25cm]
        &= r_o \parallel R_D \left[V_X\left(\frac{1}{r_o} + g_m\right) - g_m (-I_X \cdot R_G)\right]
        \label{eq:csg4}
    \end{align}

\newpage

    Now let's work with \textit{Eq.~\ref{eq:csg2}}, substituting in both \textit{Eq.~\ref{eq:csg1}} and \textit{Eq.~\ref{eq:csg4}} when necessary:
    \begin{align*}

        &= V_X \left(g_m + \frac{1}{r_o} + \frac{1}{R_S}\right) - g_m (-I_X \cdot R_G) - \frac{V_D}{r_o}\\[0.25cm]
        &= V_X \left(\frac{r_o + R_S + g_m r_o R_S}{r_o R_S}\right)\\[0.25cm]

            + I_X g_m R_G\\[0.25cm]

        \implies \frac{V_X}{I_X} &= \mathlarger{\mathlarger{\frac{\frac{r_o + R_D + g_m R_G R_D - g_m R_G(r_o + R_D)}{\cancel{r_o + R_D}}}{\frac{(r_o + R_D)(r_o + R_S + g_m r_o R_S) - R_S R_D(1 + g_m r_o)}{r_o R_S\cancel{(r_o + R_D)}}}}}\\[0.25cm]
        \implies R_{C_{SG}} &= \frac{r_o R_S\left[r_o + R_D + g_m R_G R_D - g_m R_G(r_o + R_D)\right]}{(r_o + R_D)(r_o + R_S + g_m r_o R_S) - R_S R_D(1 + g_m r_o)}
    \end{align*}

    Since we assume that $R_G = 0$, the equation simplifies to:
    \begin{equation}
        \boxed{R_{C_{SG}} = \frac{r_o R_S}{(r_o + R_S + g_m r_o R_S) - \mathlarger{\frac{R_S R_D(1 + g_m r_o)}{r_o + R_D}}}}
    \end{equation}

    \underline{\textbf{OCTC: $C_{DG}$}}\\[0.1cm]
    Below is a schematic of the small-signal model, with all caps opened, and a test source applied in place of $C_{DG}$.  As noted previously, we assume that $R_G = 0$, so we will treat it as a wire to simplify the calculations:

    \includegraphics[scale=0.12, center]{p3c_dg.jpg}\\
    
    We note that $V_D = V_X$ and $V_G = 0$.  Then we have two equations:
    \begin{align}
        I_X &= \frac{V_S}{R_S}\\[0.25cm]
        \implies V_S  &= I_X \cdot R_S
        \label{eq:cdg1}\\[0.25cm]
        I_X &= \frac{V_X}{R_D} + g_m V_S + \frac{V_{XS}}{r_o}
        \label{eq:cdg2}
    \end{align}
\newpage
    Rearranging \textit{Eq.~\ref{eq:cdg2}}, and substituting in \textit{Eq.~\ref{eq:cdg1}}
    \begin{align*}
        I_X &= V_X \left(\frac{1}{R_D} + \frac{1}{r_o}\right) - V_S \left(g_m + \frac{1}{r_o}\right)\\[0.25cm]
        &= V_X \left(\frac{1}{R_D} + \frac{1}{r_o}\right) - (I_X \cdot R_S) \left(g_m + \frac{1}{r_o}\right)\\[0.25cm]
        \implies &\; I_X \left[1 +  R_S\left(g_m + \frac{1}{r_o}\right)\right]= V_X \left(\frac{1}{R_D} + \frac{1}{r_o}\right)\\[0.25cm]
        \implies \; \Aboxed{R_{C_{DG}} &= r_o \parallel R_D \left[1 +  R_S\left(g_m + \frac{1}{r_o}\right)\right]}
    \end{align*}

    Now we can find the $-3\,dB$ bandwidth by summing up the circuit time constants and taking its inverse:
    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{i=i}^{n - 1} \tau_i &= (R_{C_{SG}} C_{SG}) + (R_{C_{DG}} C_{DG})\\[0.25cm]
        &= \left(C_{SG} \cdot \frac{r_o R_S}{(r_o + R_S + g_m r_o R_S) - \mathlarger{\frac{R_S R_D(1 + g_m r_o)}{r_o + R_D}}}\right)\\[0.25cm]
        &\qquad + \left(C_{DG}\cdot r_o \parallel R_D \left[1 +  R_S\left(g_m + \frac{1}{r_o}\right)\right]\right)\\[0.25cm]
    \end{align*}
    
    Then our final expression for the $-3\,dB$ bandwidth using OCTC is:
    \begin{equation*}
        \boxed{\mathlarger{\mathlarger{\omega_0 = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{C_{SG}(r_o R_S)}{(r_o + R_S + g_m r_o R_S) - \frac{R_S R_D(1 + g_m r_o)}{r_o + R_D}}\right) + \Bigg(C_{DG} \left(r_o \parallel R_D\right) \Big[1 +  R_S\left(g_m + \frac{1}{r_o}\right)\Big]\Bigg)}}}}
    \end{equation*}

    \item
    {
    First let's derive the mid-band gain of the circuit.  Below is the schematic we will analyze:
    
    \includegraphics[scale=0.12, center]{p3mbg.jpg}\\
    
    The input current entering the source node is: 
    \begin{align}
        i_{in} &= \frac{V_S}{R_S} + \frac{V_{SD}}{r_o} + g_m V_{SG}\\[0.25cm]
        &= V_S\left(\frac{1}{R_S} + \frac{1}{r_o} + g_m\right) - \frac{V_D}{r_o}
        \label{eq:mbg1}
    \end{align}

    Nodal analysis at the drain node yields: 
    \begin{align}
        0 &= \frac{V_D}{R_D} + \frac{V_{DS}}{r_o} - g_m V_{SG}\\[0.25cm]
        \implies &\; V_S\left(\frac{1}{r_o} + g_m\right) = V_D\left(\frac{1}{r_o} + \frac{1}{R_D}\right)\\[0.25cm]
        \implies &\; V_S = V_D \left(\frac{r_o + R_D}{\cancel{r_o} R_D}\right)\left(\frac{\cancel{r_o}}{1 + g_m r_o}\right)\\[0.25cm]
        \implies &\; V_S = V_D \left(\frac{r_o + R_D}{R_D(1 + g_m r_o)}\right)
        \label{eq:mbg2}
    \end{align}
    }
    
\newpage
    We note that $V_G = 0\,V$, and $V_D = v_{out}$, and substitute \textit{Eq.~\ref{eq:mbg2}} into \textit{Eq.~\ref{eq:mbg1}}:
    Nodal analysis at the drain node yields:
    
    \begin{align*}
        i_{in} &= \left[v_{out} \left(\frac{r_o + R_D}{R_D(1 + g_m r_o)}\right)\right]\left(\frac{1}{R_S} + \frac{1}{r_o} + g_m\right) - \frac{v_{out}}{r_o}\\[0.25cm]
        &= v_{out} \left[\left(\frac{r_o + R_D}{R_D(1 + g_m r_o)}\right)\left(\frac{r_o + R_S + g_m r_o R_S}{r_o R_S}\right) - \frac{1}{r_o}\right]\\[0.25cm]
        &= v_{out} \left[\left(\frac{r_o + R_D(r_o + R_S + g_m r_o R_S)}{r_o R_S R_D(1 + g_m r_o)}\right) - \frac{R_S R_D(1 + g_m r_o)}{r_o R_S R_D (1 + g_m r_o)}\right]\\[0.25cm]
    \end{align*}

    Then we have an expression for the gain of this transimpedance amplifier:
    \begin{equation}
        \boxed{A_i = \frac{v_{out}}{i_{in}} = \frac{r_o R_S R_D (1 + g_m r_o)}{r_o + R_D(r_o + R_S + g_m r_o R_S) - R_S R_D(1 + g_m r_o)}}
    \end{equation}
    
    Since we want to see how the gain responds to different values of $R_S$, let's factor it out of the equation to get a better idea:
    \begin{equation}
        A_i = \frac{R_S}{R_S}\left[\frac{r_o R_D (1 + g_m r_o)}{\frac{r_o}{R_S} + R_D(\frac{r_o}{R_S} + 1 + g_m r_o) - R_D(1 + g_m r_o)}\right]
    \end{equation}
    
    There are two terms with $R_S$ in the denominator that decrease as $R_S$ increases.  Since these are individual sum terms in the denominator, the overall gain will increase with everything else held constant.  Thus, we want to maximize the value of $R_S$ while keeping the amplifier in saturation.\\[0.5cm]
    This can be seen intuitively by looking at the schematic.  If $R_S = 0$, then the input current is shorted to ground in AC, and there would be no signal at the output.  With $R_S = \infty$, all of $i_{in}$ reaches $v_{out}$, and we would have maximum gain.  Then we must consider the maximum value of $R_S$ that would not take the transistor out of saturation.

    %%% SOLUTION D %%%

    \item
    {
    Any positive value of $R_G$ will decrease the bandwidth, due to the gate being tied to $C_{DG}$ and $C_{SG}$.  Thus, to maximize the bandwidth of the amplifier we want $\boxed{R_G = 0}$
    }
